## Projects
### Computational Social Scientists Network Analysis
#### Python, NetworkX, Pandas, Louvain-algorithm
- Built a weighted, undirected collaboration network and enriched nodes with metadata
- Applied Louvain algorithm to detect research communities and computed network metrics including density,
connectivity, and degree distribution
- Identified top authors by centrality measures and analyzed their influence within the network

### Community Keyword Analysis
#### Python, Pandas, WordCloud
- Consolidated 11,000+ abstracts into community-specific corpora using Louvain clustering assignments for
downstream text analysis
- Applied TF-IDF to extract distinctive keywords for each community and compared results with term frequency
analysis
- Generated 15 community-specific word clouds and profiled top authors to interpret differences between
sub-communities

### Community Detection in Global Pop Artists Collaboration Networks
#### Python, NetworkX, Louvain Algorithm, Matplotlib, Pandas
- Constructed yearly weighted collaboration networks (2017–2019) from artist co-occurrence datasets
- Created comparative network visualizations across the years, with node size reflecting degree and color
representing community
- Built a higher level community-to-community collaboration graph highlighting core clusters

### Sentimental Analysis in Taylor Swift’s Lyrics
#### Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Collected and cleaned 200+ Taylor Swift song lyrics across multiple albums for analysis using Pandas
- Applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal
- Conducted sentiment analysis to compare emotional tone across albums and evolution of lyrical themes
- Visualized key patterns in lyrical content and sentiment progression using matplotlib and seaborn
